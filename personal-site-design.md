What is you site's primary purpose?
to display the art for people to look at online, as well as create an online store. It is also ensuring that it is an easy site to navigate for everyone. It's important to ensure that it is cross platform compatible.

Who is your target audience?
buyers of this art, usually a younger demographic of people.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
I would like them to be able to click on pictures and have them expand, also navigate around the site using a drop down menu, or potentially a clickable 'map'. It's crucial to ensure that the site is easy to navigate, considered 'clean' and the focus is on the art - not written content. I would also like them to be able to 'shop' online easily.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
At the moment I'm not sure which layout will work best, but it will definitely be a more minimalistic layout. I would like to include a gallery-similar layout so incorporating the use of grids will be especially helpful. The navbar will be on the left hand side of the screen and have a drop down effect, so the layout will have a column that takes up 2 or 3 12ths of the grid.
