Media queries are used to define the 'rules' if certain conditions are met. These are mainly used for formatting in relation to screen sizes (pixel dimensions).

If a media query states:

@media (mid-width: 550px)
(rule 3)
(rule 2)
(rule 1)

if the width is at least 550 pixels wide, those conditions are met and therefore the formatting rules will alter.

The example given to us was designed as a mobile-first format, meaning that unless the screen is 550px (or more) wide, everything will be in mobile format, as opposed to many other websites that are formatted for larger screens first, and mobile second.
